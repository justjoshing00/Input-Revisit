Heres what I wanted out of this:

interfaces
-default behavior that I can override if neccessary
-the ability to quickly give that behaviour to a class

XInput classes
-different ways I can label and use groups of behaviors

commandmanger
-decouple commands from thier callers so that I can call commands from multiple places if I need to
without going through input (end turn is the most obvious example for needing that)

TODO:
-Conform to C# naming conventions
